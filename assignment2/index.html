			<h2>Subtheme: Upzoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
                <li>Which types of housing are commonly built?</li>
                <p> Motivation: Just curious to see why upzoning is so crucial.</p>
                <li>What disproportions exist between population and housing types?</li>
                <p> Motivation: According to the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing can resolve the high demand for bigger housing options for larger families without having to build single-family houses. So, I wonder what proportion of the population lives in single-family houses versus multifamily houses.</p>
                <li>What factors affect the type of housing restrictions?</li>
                <p> Motivation: According to the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing has the potential to help with the crisis, yet they are not allowed. I want to understand what factors influence which housing types are allowed.</p>
				<li>How do certain housing restrictions affect the demographics of the city?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From personal experiences and the video report on the exclusionary by design, I feel that housing restrictions are designed to segregate people. </p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The chart shows the percentage of single-family housing in all cities. However, we can observe some abnormalities in the percentages in many of the cities as they go past 100%. It looks like many cities are duplicated, representing that the municipals have both single-family zones and multifamily zones as seen in the two different shades of blue. Moving forward, it would be necessary to color code the different zones if we want to compare single-family and multifamily housing and avoid double counting.

				Expanding from Figure 1's observation, this figure illustrates the percentage of single-family and multifamily housing with a custom field that calculates the percentage of land allocated for a particular housing type. The light blue bar represents the multifamily housing zone, and the dark blue bar represents the single-family housing zone, each with their respective percentage on the label. From the diagram, we can see that in the majority of the cities where multifamily are allowed, single-family housing zones usually take up a large chunk of the land, leaving only a minute share for multifamily. In many cases, the percentage of single-family houses can go from 80% to 100%. However, it looks like the overall average for single-family zone versus multifamily zone percentages across all cities are about the same as there are many cities with 100% multifamily housing zones. However, we lack data to comprehend what type of houses are actually built in the multifamily housing zones.

				The chart depicts the overall population in different cities based on housing zones. The dark blue represents the population who live in single-family housing zones, and the light blue represents the population who live in multifamily housing zones along with their respective percentage of allowable land as labels. From the chart, we can see that multifamily housing zones are usually allowed in largely populated cities like Boston and Cambridge. The obvious solution to the housing crisis would be to build more multifamily houses in multifamily zones or expand multifamily housing zones as they can accommodate more people. However, building more multifamily houses can decrease the quality of life if the city becomes too dense.

				The bubble chart displays the population under 18 years old based on different housing types with the size of the bubbles characterizing the size of the population. The pink bubbles represent the population living in multifamily housing zones, and the purple bubbles represent the population living in single-family housing zones. This illustration shocks me as I did not expect how uneven the distribution of dependants living in multifamily housings compared to single-family housings would be. My assumption was that people living in single-family houses are more likely to have more children as they have more living space. I wonder what the distributions for other age groups are like.

				The bar graphs compare the various distribution of age groups across different cities on the MBTA list (cities that allow for multifamily housing). The pink bar represents the people living in multifamily housing zones, and the dark purple bar represents those living in single-family housing. Expanding from previous observations about the population under 18, I would expect more retired people (over 65) to live in single-family houses because they are usually more established financially with no dependents. Yet, that's not the case at all. The charts indicate that the population, across all age groups, tends to have a similar distribution in single-family and multifamily housing zones. The difference depends on the cities themselves.

				The chart exhibits the percentage of households with an income of $100,000 or more next to a chart with the percentage of single-family housing. The black tick represents households living in single-family housing zones, and the dark red represents households living in multifamily housing zones. I expected to see more of a difference in the percentages between single-family and multifamily households because I expect most single-family households to have higher incomes. Yet, the numbers are about the same in most municipalities. There is also no evidence for how the percentage of allowable land for single-family housing is affected by the percentage of people with high income living in that city. However, it does look like single-family housing zones tend to have a higher percentage of households with more than $100k income.

				<img src="Sheet 7.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The chart compares the percentage of the non-white population between single-family and multifamily housing zones where red ticks represent multifamily and black ticks represent single-family. In almost every city with both single and multifamily housing, we can see that the non-white population is always higher in multifamily housing zones than in single-family housing zones. The difference is more apparent in cities like Framingham, Lynn, Medford, Randolph, Revere, and many more. We can argue that by restricting the size of multifamily housing zones, cities can purposely lower the percentage of the non-white population in the city.

				<figcaption>
				The chart compares the percentage of family and non-family households of size 5 or more living in the same building where red ticks represent multifamily and black ticks represent single-family housing zones. From the chart, we can see that single-family tend to have a higher percentage than multifamily in family households of size 5 or more. The opposite is seen in non-family households of size 5 or more. The observation intuitively makes sense since we expect larger families to live in single-family houses while larger non-family to live in multifamily houses.

				Now, we move onto the overall map to see if there is a relationship between locations. The map illustrates the population of each city with regard to single and multifamily housing zones. With so much data, it is hard to see where the boundaries of single-family housing versus multifamily housing lie in many cities. To account for this, we might want to focus only on a portion of the data at a time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Sheet 10.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Instead of looking at the full map, we have a zoomed-in map of the percentage of households with 100k income or more where red represents the multifamily zone and grey represents the single-family zone. As discussed before in Figure 6, single-family tends to have higher percentages than multifamily housing zones. With the map, we can also account for the size of the zones. For example, in Weston, the single-family housing zone is incredibly massive compared to the multifamily housing zone. However, the percentages are not that much of a difference. This leads me to question if there is any significant difference in living conditions in the same city across different housing zones.

				Lastly, we have a map of the percentage of non-white population where red represents the multifamily zone and grey represents the single-family zone. Expanding from Figure 7 with the size of the different zones put into perspective, we can notice that a more extensive portion of the non-white population lives in the undersized multifamily housing zones in cities with both housing types. For example, in Sudbury, 75% of the population residing in the multifamily housing zone is non-white, and only 10% of the population living in the single-family housing zone is non-white.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
			In the Metro Boston Municipalities, cities have zones for only single-family housing and zones where multifamily housings are allowed. In this analysis, we have identified the different housing zone allocations, the disproportions between housing types and populations, and the demographics in various housing zones. Looking at the numbers alone, single-family and multifamily housing zones might look even. However, closer inspection within cities with both zones, the population in single-family housing zones tends to be disproportionate to the size of allocated land. On the other hand, multifamily housing zones tend to be overpopulated due to smaller land allocations. The results also indicate that non-white people with lower incomes tend to live in the multifamily housing zones. It is not clear, however, what types of houses are actually built in multifamily housing zones. With only information about the population, income, households, race, and housing zones, it is also hard to determine the exact factors that impact housing restrictions. Some options to explore in the future are to collect data about buildings (types of shops, companies, schools, etc.), number of parks, sizes of different housing zones, and types of houses built in different housing zones. This additional data will allow us to further our analysis to understand what factors affect housing restrictions and types of commonly built houses.
