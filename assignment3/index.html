			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="./sketch1.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The chart displays the population of the U.S. in 1900 and 2000 for different age and gender.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to graph every piece of information related to the population. Therefore, I use colors differentiate genders and years.</li>
				<li>With this line graph, I hoped to see the difference between the population in 1900 and 2000. </li>
				<li>The graph did a pretty good job at capturing the trends between the genders in different age groups in 1900 and 2000.</li>
                <li>Since the graph encompasses all of the fields, it's pretty hard to analyze the little differences between age groups.</li>
                <li>In the next sketch, I want to explore scaling the axes to include more information to better analyze trends between different age groups. Maybe make small multiples with different age groups.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="./sketch2.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
                    The multiple charts display the population of the U.S. in 1900 and 2000 for gender, with age grouped based on age for dependants, working adults, and retired adults.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to compare the population based on three diffrent age groups: growing, working, and retired.</li>
				<li>With the multiple line graphs, I hoped to see more distinctly the trends between the age groups in 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>Separating the populations into three age groups help me understand where the differences between the years locate. As we can see, the working age group definitely has to most distinct pattern in 2000 compared to 1900. </li>
                <li> Similar to sketch 1, I feel like this sketch stills hold too much information. It looks like the trends between female and male have little to no difference at all. To get a better picture overall, it might be good to combine the genders.</li>
                <li>In the next sketch, I want to condense the data a little bit more by combining the gender together. I think it's very beneficial to include both 1900 and 2000 in the same graph because they have fairly difference range so we can see the differences well.</li>

			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted a more simpler chart that will showcase the differences between 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>With a double bar graph, I wanted to display both the growth in number and trends between 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>Since the graph is simpler, it is very easy to see the differences in number and the trends between 1900 and 2000.</li>
                <li>Since the range in population for 1900 and 2000 are very different, there's no overlapping, making the comparision very understandable.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Question of exploration: How did the population change between 1900 and 2000?
        </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I believe that sketch 2 can effectively answer the question the most. Similar to sketch 1, sketch 2 includes every single piece of data from the dataset. Both use 4 different colors to represent the population of male and female in 1900 and 2000. However, since sketch 2 group ages based on age of dependants, working adults, and retired adults, it's much easier to see difference between the populations. This allows us to compare the populations from many different perspective (age groups, gender, etc.). Nevertheless, with four different lines in each graph, these two sketch are a little bit more complicated than neccessary. However, they are good exploration charts as they allows us to view the whole dataset all at once to find patterns. As for sketch 3, it's more simpler than both sketch 1 and 2. The design is based on observations about how gender have very similar trends within the same year, thus we can simply combine both male and female. The simple double bar chart is simple, yet still answer the question quite well. However, since we didn't include information about gender, it's impossible to conclude anything for gender. For the next phase, I want to do a mixture of sketch 2 and 3. I belive a design that is simple, yet still include all of the data to give viewers different perspectives about the population is the most powerful design.
