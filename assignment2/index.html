			<h2>Subtheme: Upzoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
                <li>Which types of housing are commonly built?</li>
                <p> Motivation: Just curious to see why upzoning is so crucial.</p>
                <li>What disporpotions exist between population and housing types?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing can resolves the high demand for bigger housing options for larger family without having to build single-family houses. So, I wonder what proportion of the population live in single-family houses versus multifamily houses.</p>
                <li>What factors affect the type of housing restrictions?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing has the potential to help with the crisis, yet they are not allowed. I want to understand what factors influence which housing types are allowed.</p>
				<li>How does certain housing restrictions affect the demographics of the city?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From personal experiences and the video report for the exlusionary by design, I feel that housing restrictions are designed to segregate people. </p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The chart shows the percentage of single-family housing in zones that allow for multifamily housing. However, we can observe some abnormalities in the percentages in many of the cities as they go past 100%. It looks like many cities are duplicated, representing that the municipals are both for only_single_family zone and not for only_single_family zone as seen in the two different shades of blue. Since we are looking at zones allowed for multifamily, it would be logical to filter out the versions of the municipals that indicate only single family housing allowed.

			<figure>
				<img src="./Sheet 2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Expanded from Figure 1, this figure illustrates the percentage of single family housings in zones where multifamily housings are allowed. As seen from the chart, while most cities allowed for multifamily housings, the majority of the land is used for single-family housings instead. In many cases, the percentage of single-family houses can go from 80% to 100%. These high rates are concerning as it indicates that the most common houses built are single-family.

			<figure>
				<img src="./Sheet 3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The chart demonstrates the population in different cities based on housing types. The dark blue represents the population who live in single-family houses and the light blue represents the population who live in multifamily houses. As we can see from the labels on the bars, while the percentage of single-family housing zone are very high compared to the multifamily housing zone, the population are not to the same proportion. The obvious solution to the housing crisis would be to build more multifamily housings as they can accomdate more people. However, building more multifamily houses can decrease the quality of life as the density in the city increases.
