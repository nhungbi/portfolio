			<h2>Subtheme: Upzoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
                <li>Which types of housing are commonly built?</li>
                <p> Motivation: Just curious to see why upzoning is so crucial.</p>
                <li>What disporpotions exist between population and housing types?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing can resolves the high demand for bigger housing options for larger family without having to build single-family houses. So, I wonder what proportion of the population live in single-family houses versus multifamily houses.</p>
                <li>What factors affect the type of housing restrictions?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing has the potential to help with the crisis, yet they are not allowed. I want to understand what factors influence which housing types are allowed.</p>
				<li>How does certain housing restrictions affect the demographics of the city?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From personal experiences and the video report for the exlusionary by design, I feel that housing restrictions are designed to segregate people. </p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The chart shows the percentage of single-family housing in all cities. However, we can observe some abnormalities in the percentages in many of the cities as they go past 100%. It looks like many cities are duplicated, representing that the municipals are both for only singlefamily zone and for multifamily zone as seen in the two different shades of blue. Moving forward, it would be neccessary to separate the different zones if we want to compare single-family and multifamily housings.

				Expanding on from Figure 1's observation, this figure illustrates the percentage of single-family and multifamily housings with a custom field. The light blue bar represents the multifamily housing zone and the dark blue bar represents the single-family housing zone, each with their respective percentage of allowable land on the label. From the chart, we can see that in the majority of cities where multifamily are allowed, single-family housing zone usually take up a large chunk of the land, leaving a small percentage only to multifamily. In many cases, the percentage of single-family houses can go from 80% to 100%. However, it looks like overall average for single-family zone versus multifamily zone percentages in all cities are about the same as there are many cities with 100% multifamily zones.

				<figcaption>
				The chart illustrates the overall population in different cities based on housing zones. The dark blue represents the population who live in single-family housing zone and the light blue represents the population who live in multifamily housing zone along with their respective percentage of allowable land as labels. From the chart, we can see that multifamily housing zones are usually allowed in largely populated cities like Boston and Cambridge. However, I wonder how much single-family houses compared to multifamily houses are actually built in multifamily housing zone. The obvious solution to the housing crisis would be to build more multifamily houses in multifamily zone as they can accommondate more people. However, building more multifamily houses can decrease the quality of life as the density in the city increases. With only these information, it is hard to tell which type of houses are commonly built.

				The bubble chart illustrates the population under 18 years based on different housing types. The pink bubbles represent the population living in multifamily housing zone and the purple bubbles represent the population living in single-family housing zone. This illustration shocks me as I did not expect how uneven the distribution of dependants living in multifamily housings compared to single-family housings would be. My inference was that people living in single-family houses are more likely to have more children as they can afford to do so. I wonder what is the distributions for other age groups are like.

				The bar graphs compare the different distribution of age groups across different cities, each indicating which housing zone the population is from. The pink bar represents the people living in multifamily housing zone while the dark purple bar represents the people living in single-family housings. Expanding from previous observation about the population under 18, I would expect more retired people (over 65) to live in single-family houses because they are usually more established financially with no dependants. Yet, that's not the case at all. The charts indicates that people, across all age groups tend to live in multifamily housing zones. Only in some cities (eg. Woburn) would this observation flipped. I wonder what causes the difference in the trend. Noticably, some rows were excluded as since their populations were recorded as 0.

				The chart displays the percentage of households with an income of $100,000 or more with labels. The dark blue represent households living in single-family housings and the light blue represent households living in multifamily housings. I expected to see more of a difference between the percentages between single-family and multifamily households because I expect most single-family households to have higher income. Yet, the numbers are about the same in most municipals.

				<figcaption>
				The chart compares the percentage of non-white population between single-family and multifamily housing zone where pink represents multifamily and purple represents single-family. In almost every municipals where there are both single and multifamily housing, we can see that non-white population is always greater in multifamily housing zone than single-family housing zone. We can argue that by restricting the size of multifamily housing zone, cities can lower the percentage of non-white population in the city.
