			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> I wanted to graph every piece of information related to the population. Therefore, I use different colors to differentiate genders and years.</li>
				<li> With the line graph, I hoped to see any differences between the population in 1900 and 2000. </li>
				<li>The graph did a pretty good job of capturing the trends between the genders in different age groups in 1900 and 2000.</li>
                <li>Since the graph encompasses all of the fields, it's pretty hard to analyze the little differences between age groups.</li>
                <li>In the next sketch, I want to explore small multiples with different age groups.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="./sketch2.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
                    The multiple charts display the population of the U.S. in 1900 and 2000 for gender, with age grouped based on age for dependants, working adults, and retired adults.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to compare the population based on three different age groups: dependent children, working adults, and retired adults.</li>
				<li>With the multiple line graphs, I hoped to see more distinctly the trends between the age groups in 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>Dividing the people into three age groups helped me understand where the most apparent discrepancies between the years lie. As we can see, the working age group has the most distinct pattern in 2000 compared to 1900. </li>
                <li> Similar to sketch 1, I feel that this sketch is still too busy. Notice that the trends between females and males indicate little to no difference in the same year. To get a better picture overall, it might be good to combine the genders.</li>
                <li>In the next sketch, I want to condense the data a little bit more by combining the genders. I think it's very beneficial to include both 1900 and 2000 in the same graph because they have fairly different ranges so we can see the differences well.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted a simpler graph to showcase the differences between 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>With a double bar graph, I wanted to display both the growth in number and trends between 1900 and 2000. Fortunately, the range in population for 1900 and 2000 are very different with no overlapping. </li>
				<li>Since the graph is more straightforward, it is easier to see the differences in numbers and the trends between 1900 and 2000.</li>
                <li>However, the trend line is definitely more painless to see with a line or scatter plot compared to a bar graph unless the pattern is obvious as seen in the decreasing line in 1900.</li>
			</ul>

        <p>
            Question of exploration in phase 1: How did the population change between 1900 and 2000?
        </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I believe that Sketch 2 can answer the question the most effectively. Similar to Sketch 1, Sketch 2 includes every field and row of data from the dataset. Nevertheless, with four different colored lines in each graph, these two sketches are a little bit more complicated than necessary. Since Sketch 2 clusters ages based on the age of dependants, working adults, and retired adults, the differences between the age groups in 1900 and 2000 are more apparent. This separation allows us to easily compare the populations from different perspectives (age groups, gender, etc.). Nonetheless, they are good exploration charts as they enable us to view the whole dataset broadly to find patterns. As for Sketch 3, it's simpler than both sketches 1 and 2. The design is inspired by the observations about how males and females have very similar trends within the same year. Thus, we can combine males and females. The double bar chart is simple, yet still answers the question quite well. However, since we didn't include information about gender, it's impossible to conclude anything about gender. For the next phase, I want to replicate Sketch 2 with additional play in texture to simplify the design. I believe a design that is straightforward, yet still includes all essential information about the dataset to give viewers different perspectives about the population is quite influential.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

		<p>
			By utilizing small multiples, the multiple charts can constructively illustrate distinct pattern changes between different age groups in 1900 and 2000. By including both genders as distinct shapes, we can easily see that there were little to no differences between the trends in each age group for different genders. With circles, rounded edges, representing females, and squares, straight edges, representing males, our eyes can effortlessly distinguish the two even when the shapes overlap. Not only that, if any two points overlap each other equally, we can still see the overlapped points without much effort since the circles can fit inside the squares almost perfectly. To better answer the question about different age groups, I split the dataset into three based on the age of dependants (~0-20), working adults(~21-64), and retired adults (~65+). This choice allows readers to grasp the differences within each age group for 1900 and 2000 without much effort. The colors purple and gold represent 1900 and 2000, respectively. By representing 2000 with gold, one can argue that 2000 is the "golden" year with the expansion of population in number and a non-decreasing pattern in the dependent population compared to 1900. By plotting each data point, we can also see the actual trend line within each age group. The invisible trend lines demonstrate the steady decrease in population in 1900 and the slight increase jump, especially in dependants and working adults, combined with a steep decline in working and retired adults in the 2000 population. Since the chart looks at the population broadly, we might be underestimating the differences between the same genders in different years. However, since we want to communicate the differences between age groups, it is more beneficial to include both genders separately.

      <p>
		Sketching graphs by hand without the ease of "undoing", forces me to finish ideas even if I recognize the flaws of the designs in the process of sketching them. The repetitive procedure of plotting each data point by hand helps me broaden my understanding of the dataset, and the strengths and flaws of certain designs. Since I attempted to look at the overall trends in the dataset, I realized how broad and unclear my phase 1 question was since there were so many different aspects I could take based on the chart. Thus, I leaned toward sketches 2 and 3 for phase 2 since they are more tailored toward a particular aspect of the population. For example, Sketch 2 focuses on the differences between age groups, and Sketch 3 looks at the overall number at each age. While Sketch 3 provides a simple way to analyze the overall trends in the population, it obscures the similarities between the genders. Hence, I leaned toward the Sketch 2 design more but learned to simplify the design as much as possible for clarity. Instead of using four different colors, I combine texture (shapes) and colors to represent different genders in the two years. Not only that, the bar graph did not represent the trend lines as clearly as a scatterplot unless there is a pronounced trend (decreasing as seen in 1900). Nevertheless, phase 1 allows me to have a better understanding and encourages me to tailor a more explicit question to the dataset. Lastly, by sketching graphs by hand, I can freely use my creativity and judgment to decide how to best represent a dataset. This process is influential to my final design as I'm not limiting my design and imagination to any software.
