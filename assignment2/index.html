			<h2>Subtheme: Upzoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
                <li>Which types of housing are commonly built?</li>
                <p> Motivation: Just curious to see why upzoning is so crucial.</p>
                <li>What disporpotions exist between population and housing types?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing can resolves the high demand for bigger housing options for larger family without having to build single-family houses. So, I wonder what proportion of the population live in single-family houses versus multifamily houses.</p>
                <li>What factors affect the type of housing restrictions?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From the Washington Post, "missing middle" housing has the potential to help with the crisis, yet they are not allowed. I want to understand what factors influence which housing types are allowed.</p>
				<li>How does certain housing restrictions affect the demographics of the city?</li>
                <p> Motivation: From personal experiences and the video report for the exlusionary by design, I feel that housing restrictions are designed to segregate people. </p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The chart shows the percentage of single-family housing in all cities. However, we can observe some abnormalities in the percentages in many of the cities as they go past 100%. It looks like many cities are duplicated, representing that the municipals are both for only singlefamily zone and for multifamily zone as seen in the two different shades of blue. Moving forward, it would be neccessary to separate the different zones if we want to compare single-family and multifamily housings.

				Expanding on from Figure 1's observation, this figure illustrates the percentage of single-family and multifamily housings with a custom field. The light blue bar represents the multifamily housing zone and the dark blue bar represents the single-family housing zone, each with their respective percentage of allowable land on the label. From the chart, we can see that in the majority of cities where multifamily are allowed, single-family housing zone usually take up a large chunk of the land, leaving a small percentage only to multifamily. In many cases, the percentage of single-family houses can go from 80% to 100%. However, it looks like overall average for single-family zone versus multifamily zone percentages in all cities are about the same as there are many cities with 100% multifamily zones.

				<figcaption>
				The chart illustrates the overall population in different cities based on housing zones. The dark blue represents the population who live in single-family housing zone and the light blue represents the population who live in multifamily housing zone along with their respective percentage of allowable land as labels. From the chart, we can see that multifamily housing zones are usually allowed in largely populated cities like Boston and Cambridge. However, I wonder how much single-family houses compared to multifamily houses are actually built in multifamily housing zone. The obvious solution to the housing crisis would be to build more multifamily houses in multifamily zone as they can accommondate more people. However, building more multifamily houses can decrease the quality of life as the density in the city increases. With only these information, it is hard to tell which type of houses are commonly built.

				The bubble chart illustrates the population under 18 years based on different housing types. The pink bubbles represent the population living in multifamily housing zone and the purple bubbles represent the population living in single-family housing zone. This illustration shocks me as I did not expect how uneven the distribution of dependants living in multifamily housings compared to single-family housings would be. My inference was that people living in single-family houses are more likely to have more children as they have more living space. I wonder what is the distributions for other age groups are like.

				The bar graphs compare the different distribution of age groups across different cities on the MBTA list (cities that allow for multifamily housings). The pink bar represents the people living in multifamily housing zone while the dark purple bar represents the people living in single-family housings. Expanding from previous observation about the population under 18, I would expect more retired people (over 65) to live in single-family houses because they are usually more established financially with no dependants. Yet, that's not the case at all. The charts indicates that the population, across all age groups, tend to have similar distribution in single-family and multifamily housing zones. The difference depends on the cities themselves.

				The chart displays the percentage of households with an income of $100,000 or more with labels next to a chart with the percentage of single-family housing. The black tick represents household living in single-family housing zone and the dark red represent households living in multifamily housing zone. I expected to see more of a difference between the percentages between single-family and multifamily households because I expect most single-family households to have higher income. Yet, the numbers are about the same in most municipals. There is also no evidence for how the percentage of single-family housing is affected by the percentage of people with high income living in that city. However, it does look like single-family housing zone tend to have higher percentage of households with more than $100k income.

				<img src="Sheet 7.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The chart compares the percentage of non-white population between single-family and multifamily housing zone where red ticks represent multifamily and black ticks represent single-family. In almost every municipals where there are both single and multifamily housing, we can see that non-white population is always greater in multifamily housing zone than single-family housing zone. The difference is more apparent in cities like Framinghamn Lynn, Medford, Randolph, Revere, and many more. We can argue that by restricting the size of multifamily housing zone, cities can purposely lower the percentage of non-white population in the city.

				<figcaption>
				The chart compares the percentage of family and non-family households of size 5 or more living in the same building where red ticks represent multifamily and black ticks represent single-family housing zone. From the chart, we can see that single-family tend to have higher percentage than multifamily in family households of size 5 or more. The opposite is seen in non-family households of size 5 or more. This intuitively make sense since we expect larger family to live in single-family houses while larger non-family to live in multifamily houses.

				Now, we move onto the overall map to see if there is relationship between locations. The map illustrate the population of each city with regard to single and multifamily. With so much data, it is hard to see the where boundaries of single-family housing versus multifamily housing lies in cities with both. To account for this, we might want to focus only on a portion of the data.

				<img src="Sheet 10.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Instead of looking at the full map, we have a zoomed in map of the percentage of households with 100k income or more where red represents multifamily zone and grey represents single-family zone. As discussed before in figure 6, single-family tends to have higher percentages than multifamily housing zone. With the map, we can also account for the size of the zones. For example, in Weston, the single-family housing zone is incredibly massive compared to the multifamily housing zone. However, the percentages are not that much of a difference. I wonder if there is any significant difference in living conditions in the same city across different housing zone.
