      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					The infographic showcases significant indications of progress in the accessibility of abortion for women by analyzing the percentage of residents obtaining abortions out of state and the change in the development of abortion clinics/providers across states.
				</figcaption>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> 
					Decision: Using an infographic instead of one chart only.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 1
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: Since the dataset is not very kind to this side of the argument, I wanted to incorporate different types of graphs that can emphasize the big picture and showcase the small details in conjunction with each other. By using pie charts and a bar graph with bins, I can effectively persuade the readers that the overall trends in accessibility for abortions are looking up for women. However, these two choices hide quite a bit of detail about the dataset, so I wanted to incorporate a map to display information about each state to gain the readers' trust. Before settling on three types, I considered using a bubble chart, a line chart with the area filled out, and other variations of the bar chart. Unfortunately, these graphs emphasize the alarming circumstances of each state (number/magnitude wise), thus weakening the position since the dataset does not look very good for women if we graph each state in comparison with one another for most of the dataset fields. Due to the obstruction of these details for the bar and pie charts, I considered this decision 1 on the scale.
					</li>

				</ul>
				<li>Decision: Keeping the color scheme to simple, muted colors with pops of green and gentle font.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 1.5
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: Since I'm making an infographic, the simple color scheme allows me to tie the graphs together for a more comprehensive look instead of scraps placed next to each other. With the argument being positive, I wanted to use a bold, intense green to set the tone of the infographic to be optimistic and reassuring. Combined with a gentle, instead of fierce font, I wanted to establish the mood as calm and peaceful as the readers take in the positive news. I did consider using more variety of colors, however, I feel like they would distract the readers from the message of the graphs. With pops of green representing the positive changes while grey representing the negative changes, readers will naturally focus on the green elements. Therefore, allowing me to manipulate which aspects of the data I want them to see. Since I am purposely appealing to only particular elements, I score this decision a 1.5 because it is slightly deceptive.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Decision: Using a bar chart with bins of 25.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: -1
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: Since the majority of the states for Percentage of Residents Obtaining Abortions Out of State in 2020 are in the range of 0 to 25, binning at around 25 allows me to deceptively convince the readers that 37 out of 51 states (counting Washington, D.C.) are at the "0%" mark. In addition, I elongated the graph in the vertical direction to exaggerate the differences in the bins to emphasize that most of the states are doing well for women. This decision made such a big difference because widening the bars to fit across the screen weakens the differences in the number of states across bins. Technically, I'm not manipulating the data directly, just the cutoffs for the bins. Therefore, I would say these decisions are -1 on the scale. Note that there is only information for the year 2020 for this particular field. Thus, I tried to include information that covers the years 2014 to 2020 for the other graphs to make up for the lack of data.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Decision: Using two pie charts to show the change in the number of abortion clinics/providers across different states.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: -1.5
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: The data for the change in the number of abortion clinics/providers are split into two: 2014 to 2017 and 2017 to 2020. Since there is no data on the number of clinics/providers in 2014 (2017 and 2020 exist), I cannot combine the two. Nevertheless, having the two pie charts do look more trustworthy. I daresay that these two charts are the most deceptive parts of this infographic. By combining no change and an increase in change in the number of abortion clinics/providers, the pie chart looks very favorable to the argument. However, if one takes a look at the data itself, that will not be the case. The reasons lie in the fact that there are quite a bit of states with 0 change. Not only that, states with a decreasing number of clinics have a higher magnitude overall than states with an increasing number of clinics. So, focusing on the count of the states was a wise choice. Hence, I score this decision as -1.5. To aid my argument, I also stress more on the progress by giving the text a bright green color and the other side a muted grey color.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Decision: Using a map to display the percentage change in the number of counties without a known abortion provider between 2014 and 2020.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 1
					</li>
					<li>
						I must include a map because the other charts do not explicitly present the individual states. Fortunately, the percentage change in the number of counties without a known abortion provider between 2014 and 2020 across states looks quite promising. It also helps to combine decrease and no change since there are a lot of states with no change. Note that this is a bit deceptive to count no change as a sign of improvement, hence the score of 1. In addition, by enlarging the size of the circles on a range of -70 to 70, I can highlight the green circles over grey ones since states with decreasing percentages usually have larger magnitudes than states with increasing percentages. Overall, the map looks optimistic as readers can see more pops of green than gray. I also split the states into regions to make it easier to recognize patterns in various regions. My goal is to be as transparent as possible to gain the readers' trust. One thing I wished I could have implemented was assigning different colors to the legend. For example, from 0 to -70, the circles should be green. It does not seem possible on Tableu.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="AgainstAccessibility.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The infographic exhibits alarming indications of regression in the accessibility of abortion for women in the analysis of the percentage change of women in a county without an abortion provider, percentages of the number of counties without a known abortion provider, and percentage change in the number of abortion clinics across states between 2014 to 2020. (Note: if the graph is too hard to see here, please refer to a higher quality graph here https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ca4eb062euerudlloadez/AgainstAccessibility.pdf?rlkey=mo6l8tfj78d8mmnxkvpnz3d5r&dl=0. )

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Decision: Using an infographic instead of one chart only. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 2
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: The dataset has many fields that support this side without much effort in manipulating the data. Hence, I wanted to strengthen my argument by incorporating diverse, complementary pieces of information in different forms. By utilizing a bubble chart, I can effectively put into perspective how dire the situation is. In addition, the simple bar charts underscore the alarmingly high numbers to bring the readers on their feet. Lastly, the maps put everything into perspective by giving readers a chance to see patterns across different regions. Graphs like pie charts would not add much to the argument since I wanted to emphasize the magnitude of each state rather than the overall pattern of the states. Unlike the other position, none of these graphs are there to deceive the readers but to inform the readers of the concerns instead. Hence, I scored it a 2.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Decision: Keeping the color scheme to simple, muted colors with pops of red and bold font. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 1.5
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: The simple color scheme allows me to tie the graphs together for a more comprehensive look instead of scraps placed next to one another. Using a ferocious red as the prominent color, I can set the tone to pessimistic and fearful. Combined with an assertive, bolded font, I wanted to establish the message as a call to action as the readers digest the alarming news. With pops of red focusing on the negative aspects and grey representing the insignificant progress, I can effectively intensify the alarming crisis further in all of the graphs. Since I'm not placing the same weight on the other side, I would rate this a 1.5 on the scale because it is slightly deceptive.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Decision: Using a bubble chart to show the percentage change of women aged 15 to 44 in a county without an abortion provider between 2014 and 2020.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 2
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: The percentage change of women aged 15 to 44 in a county without an abortion provider between 2014 and 2020 reveals alarming high percentages in states with increasing values. I wanted to represent each state with their corresponding size depending on the magnitude of the change so readers can see for themselves the dire state the U.S. was in between 2014 and 2020. The bubble chart does this job incredibly well. We can almost see the red, gigantic circles engulfing the minuscule grey circles in the middle. In addition, the summary in the top right corner stresses that a large number of states regressed. I considered using a simple bar chart before, but it did not have the same dramatic effect as the bubble chart. Out of all of the charts on the infographic, I consider the bubble chart the most noteworthy since you can see how problematic the situation is at first glance. There's no deception here, so I scored it a 2.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Decision: Using a double bar chart to show the average percentage of the number of counties without a known abortion provider by region. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 2
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: There's no deception here, hence a score of 2. The percentages of the number of counties without a known abortion provider in 2014 and 2020 expose disturbing high percentages across all states. Instead of using a simple bar chart to graph each state, I find graphing the averages of each region more compelling as we can see more clearly where the problems lie. As for the double chart, I wanted to represent both years near one another for comparison. I tried reversing the bars so they would face downward. However, I found it not as persuasive since I wanted to stress that these numbers are elevated over the roof. Hence, the bars are shooting upward. The dataset played well into the argument, so I did not have to do much manipulation.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Decision: Using two maps to show the percentage change in the number of abortion clinics across states.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Score: 1
					</li>
					<li>
						Explanation: The two maps show the percentage change in the number of abortion clinics across states from 2014 to 2017 and 2017 to 2020. There is not enough data to combine the two, hence the two maps. Hawaii and Alaska were filtered out so the focus could stay on the mainland of the United States. Looking at the overall trend, one can easily see that the majority of the states have red circles. It also helps that we are considering both decrease and no change as red. To further our argument, I specifically choose to keep the range of sizes small. This decision allows states with no change to appear significant. You can argue that the maps are a bit deceptive because of the play in sizing, hence a score of 1. Nevertheless, the maps further the argument by showcasing an overall trend of lack of change or decrease in the number of abortion clinics/providers across the United States. These maps are compelling supplements to the other graphs.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		Overall, the entire process was quite demanding. To produce captivating visuals, I must understand the dataset front and back. If the dataset aids the argument without much manipulation, then we are blessed since this is probably not the case usually. However, it is still crucial to understand how to manipulate the data by grouping, binning, or calculating new fields. The manipulations allow us to accentuate particular aspects to further our argument. The same idea applies to datasets that do not support our argument well. I learned to use different means to obscure the flaws and highlight the little bit of "goodness" the dataset has. For example, instead of focusing solely on the actual numbers of the data, I can treat the numbers as binary (-1 or 1) to see if it can help. This method allows me to create persuasive visuals to support my proposition even though the dataset does not support it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After this experience, I can say that any analysis and visualization is ethical as long as they don't directly manipulate the raw data and filter out significant chunks of the dataset. It's also tough to define what's considered ethical. When you are trying to argue for a position, who can blame you if you use every means possible to further your argument? If the deceptions are not obvious, then it is considered clever. If we can effortlessly point out the deceptions at a glance, then it is considered misleading. As for acceptable, if the visuals can deceive me, then I can accept anything. It's hard to draw a line since there are so many different aspects to consider depending on the topics.
